## Initial post, will update later
However, how do I debug/troubleshooting the variables and any other error?
Here are some help links for my own use:
1. [Troubleshooting](https://help.github.com/articles/troubleshooting-jekyll-builds/).
2. [Basic markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)
3. [Advanced markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)
4. Github Pages use Jekyll 3.0 which supports markdown via [kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html#quick-reference)

## Initial post, will update later
However, how do I debug/troubleshooting the variables and any other error?  
Here are some help links for my own use:  
1. [Troubleshooting](https://help.github.com/articles/troubleshooting-jekyll-builds/).  
2. [Basic markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)  
3. [Advanced markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)  
4. Github Pages use Jekyll 3.0 which supports markdown via [kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html#quick-reference)
5. Jekyll's [Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/)
